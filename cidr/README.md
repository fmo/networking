# What is CIDR?

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method used to assign IP addresses and manage networks more efficiently. It replaced the older system of classful addressing to make better use of limited IP address space.

## Breaking It Down

### IP Address

An IP address identifies devices on a network

### Subnet Mask

A subnet mask determines which part of an IP address is the network and which part is for individual devices

### CIDR Notation

* CIDR simplifies subnet masks by representing them with a / followed by a number (e.g., /24)
* The number after / tells you how many bits in the IP address are reserved for the network part.



So simply CIDR replaces the traditional subnet mask.

# hub, switch, & router

A hub is a simple networking device used to connect multiple computers or devices within a local area network (LAN). It receives data from one device and broadcasts it to all other connected devices, without filtering or directing the data to a specific destination.

A switch is a networking device used to connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and manage data traffic efficiently. Unlike a hub, a switch directs data only to the specific device it is intended for, using the deviceâ€™s MAC address, which helps reduce network congestion and improve performance.

A router connects your local network to the internet, whereas hubs and switches only manage communication within a local network.

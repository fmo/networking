On a Mac, the ipconfig command is used to configure network interfaces and retrieve network configuration information. It's similar to the ifconfig command but is used for more specific network configuration tasks, such as obtaining IP addresses, DNS information, and renewing DHCP leases

# hub, switch, & router

A hub is a simple networking device used to connect multiple computers or devices within a local area network (LAN). It receives data from one device and broadcasts it to all other connected devices, without filtering or directing the data to a specific destination.

A switch is a networking device used to connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and manage data traffic efficiently. Unlike a hub, a switch directs data only to the specific device it is intended for, using the deviceâ€™s MAC address, which helps reduce network congestion and improve performance.

A router connects your local network to the internet, whereas hubs and switches only manage communication within a local network.

hubs and switches used for creating networks, while routers are used for connect networks
